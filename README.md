# Google-Data-analytics-Capstone
This is the project done as part of the Google Data analytics Capstone project

Google Data Analytics Capstone Project using Cyclistic (Divvy) bike data.

This project was done as part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate.

Ask Phase:

Analyze how many annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes in order to determine
the best marketing strategy and based on the outcome of analysis, convert casual riders into
annual members to improve the business.

Prepare Phase:

The data was downloaded directly from the Divvy Bikes website:
https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html
I have used tools, Microsoft excel, Google Sheets, Google Big query (SQL) and Tableau while
doing this project.

I have modified data to remove errors and also used partial data as big query has a data limit for
me to use.

Process Phase:

After importing the data, the first step was to inspect each column for errors. Update columns
where there are null values to appropriate values. New columns, ride_length,Day_of_week and
ymd (y-year,m-month, d-day) were added to the consolidated excel sheet per each year
(2020,2021,2022 data). A description of the process and queries were described in the file
Big_Query_SQL.sql

Analyze Phase:

In this phase, queries were created to uncover trends that were highlighted in the data
visualizations.

Share Phase:

Visualizations were created using Tableau. Published at the tableau and link given below.

Act Phase:

So from the dashboards (share phase), it was clear that annual members are using cyclistic bikes more than casual users. So a decision can be made that cyclistic company business will be improved if casual riders are converted to annual members.
